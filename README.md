üìö Overview

This project demonstrates Image Steganography using Java, focusing on text encryption within images. The encryption code hides messages by manipulating the blue channel of each pixel, ensuring that the image's appearance remains unchanged. A password protection feature secures the encryption process, providing a robust method for safe message transmission.

üöÄ Steps to Run the Encryption Code

1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

Java JDK 8 or higher installed on your system.

A suitable IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

https://github.com/pratikdevre/pratik_steganography.git
cd pratik_steganography

3Ô∏è‚É£ Add Required Image

Place the image file (e.g., mypic.jpg) in the project directory.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Compile the Encryption Code

javac ImageSteganography.java

5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Encryption Program

java ImageSteganography

Enter the secret message and password when prompted.

The program will generate an encrypted image (encryptedImage.png) in the project directory, containing the hidden message.

üéØ Encryption complete! Your message is now securely hidden within the image.
